# surfs_up Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to help W. Avy conduct some analytics on a weather data. He wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Below is the table summarizes June temperature statistics.

Below is the table summarizes December temperature statistics.

According to the above two tables, we can get that:

* Average temperature between June and December is 74.94 and 71.04 degrees respectively, which are moderate temperature and similar between the two between the two periods from an average standpoint.
* The maximum temperatures of June and December 85 and 83 are also very similar considering maximum temperature.
* The minimum temperature of June and December 64 and 56 show the greatest variance, and reflects a lower temperature level in December.

## Summary

According to the data analysis we conducted for temperature in June and December, it might be a good idea to open the Surf & Ice Cream Shop in Oahu. In addition, Comparing the two different months, the average temperatures are remarkably similar between the June and December. However the ranges of temperatures in June are quite warmer compared to the ranges of temperature in December, which are colder.

One query I would like to perform to gather more information about the wind condition, wave swells, which may also considered as a factor for surfing.

Secondly, I would like to get more information for indicators of extreme weather events to know if hurricanes, tsunami, and other extreme weather events were more likely to occur in summer or winter months, which will be helpful for safety planning.
